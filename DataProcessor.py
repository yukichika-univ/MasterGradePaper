	''' an important purpose of this generator function is to balance a number os aspect:
		For efficiency:
			
			E1-Data with similar number of time steps must be in the same batches, otherwise, the treatment of masked out timesteps due to single long sequences
			will yield unnecessary works
			
			E2-Data must be provided to the training algorithm at a decent speed which implies that the number of disk reads should not be exaggerated.
			
		For performance:
			
			P1-The different batches during an epoch must come in different orders every time, otherwise the model might end up in a certain training pattern
			that doesn't take it to new and hopefully better places of the loss function surface
			
			P2-Even though it doesn't matter which order the data in a batch has, one should try to mix the contents of the batches so that batches contain
			different members between epochs
	
		Restrictions:
			
			R1-All training data cannot be kept in memory at once since this takes too much RAM
			
		Solution: The solution is first to sort all the data durng preprocessing by the length of the input so that similar length pattern end up together (E1).
		For the sake of R1 we can't store all these patterns in the same file and for the sake of E2, we should not store a single pattern in a single file.
		For the sake of P1, we must generate the data in an order that is different between runs and so we need to find a decent file size to store file in.
		We then randomly order these files and take data from them continuously. Now, if every pattern would be in a file on its own, then this would ensure
		P1 but E2 would be violated. If we did the opposite R1 would be violated and also both P1 and P2 since no ordering of files would be possible. Let's say
		we find a middle point, where a certain amount of P1 would be fulfilled by randomly order files. If we had very large files, then the random ordering
		wouldn't do much good but with very small files, P2 would not be fulfilled. To ensure P2, we need to generate a number of batches from the same data
		so that we can ensure that shuffling it beforehand will lead to batches with slightly differing content. On the other hand, the smaller the files, the
		greater impact will randomly ordering the files have on P1. We may then choose to have a cache of several streams of training data and pick randomly
		from them as well, then P1 would be ensured both by random file ordering and by random cache / bin choices during generation. Furthermore, P2 would be
		ensured since the files would be large enough, relative to batch size, so that an internal shuffling leads to batches of different content. E1 would be
		fulfilled since the files are bigger than the batch size (even a multiple) and so mostly, batches would contain same size lengths and in the few cases
		where content from different bins need to be used simulatenously, it is still about very few times after all. E2 would be sufficiently fulfilled and
		this is not believed to be a very hard restrictions. In worst case, we can multi-thread and prepare the next batch while the former batch is run by the
		training algorithm. Finally, R1 is in the danger since to ensure most of the previous, we would have to have quite much data in memory at once. So, if
		memory becomes an issue, increase the number of reads, that is, decrease the size of files.
		
		Given a batch size of 32-512, 512 * 8 is thought to give large enough files so that internal shuffling ensures a mixture between bathes from a certain
		seq length. Still, the files would be sufficiently small so that shuffling file names would ensure different batch orderings and if that wouldn't be enough,
		a cache of size 10 makes it highly unlikely that we pick several batches in a row from the same bin.Of course, all parameters are subjects to testing
